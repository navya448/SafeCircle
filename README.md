## SafeCircle: Your Personal Safety Companion

SafeCircle is a comprehensive safety application built to empower users with tools and information to enhance their personal security. Whether you're navigating unfamiliar areas, need quick access to emergency contacts, or want to gain insights into potential risks, SafeCircle provides a centralized platform for your safety needs.

## The Problem

Navigating a university campus, especially one that is geographically isolated, can often feel unnerving. As a female student, I have personally experienced the anxiety that comes with walking alone late at night or through poorly lit areas. This feeling of vulnerability is a significant issue for many students, detracting from the sense of community and freedom that a campus should offer. SafeCircle was born from this personal experience, with the mission to create a tool that not only provides a quick way to call for help but also empowers students to make smarter, safer decisions about their routes and daily routines. It's about creating a circle of safety for everyone.
